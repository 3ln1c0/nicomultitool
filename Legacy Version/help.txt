2. Open ProcessHacker - Feature-rich alternative to task manager (May work if your task manager is locked.) 

3. Admin Bypass - Methods to try to get administrator permissions if you don't have them.
	- BruteForce: Try to brute force the administrator password. It can take a long time on slow computers.
	- FakeBug: Opens a window asking for administrator permissions. The window never closes, so it seems like a bug. When the administrator enters the password, a CMD will 	open with administrator permissions that you can use to give yourself administrator status. Make sure you close any CMD windows you have before opening it.

4. Fakes - Fake viruses, bugs and other things.
	- Fake bug: It makes it look like Windows is buggy, but in reality it is not. (This simply kills explorer.exe)
